# Welcome 2 mlflow_test 👋
This is a learning repository! Here I'm approaching MLflow for the first time.

## What is MLflow? 🦾
MLflow is an **open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**. It tackles four primary functions:

- Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking). 
- Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow Projects). 
- Managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models). 
- Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations (MLflow Model Registry).


## Time-Series training 📈
I want to train different time-series models (ARIMA) using the MLflow framework.
I would compare the performance with and without exogenous variables.
